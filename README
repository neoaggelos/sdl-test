About
======

This repo is meant to keep my test programs from SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer).
They can be used as "references" for specific SDL
features and functions. Some also show off how to use SDL with OpenGL and makes
use of a few functions of OGL.

Installation
=============

I am really sorry about that, but currently no makefile is provided. Generally,
all the programs will compile by using this command:

+============================================================+
|gcc source.c -o executable -lSDL -lGL -lGLU -lglut -lSDL_ttf|
+============================================================+

NOTE that not all linker flags are required for all programs. So, if you unsure,
just add all of them.

ps. Makefile is currently on the making.
